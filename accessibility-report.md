## Market Target

Pentagon-113 would primarily target young to middle-aged professionals with emerging interest in financial investment, particularly those who feel overwhelmed by complex financial platforms. Our ideal users are individuals between ages 25-45 who want to understand stock markets without being buried in technical jargon or bombarded by advertising. These potential customers might include entry-level investors, graduate students, young professionals in tech and business sectors, and individuals looking to start their investment journey with a user-friendly, non-intimidating tool. The application's clean design and straightforward features make it particularly attractive to millennials and Gen Z users who prefer intuitive, minimalist digital experiences.

## Demographic Usage Considerations

Our stock analysis application might inadvertently be less accessible to older demographics or individuals with limited technological literacy due to its digital-first approach. Users without consistent internet access, those uncomfortable with digital interfaces, or individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds might find the application less usable. Additionally, the application's reliance on English-language interfaces and primarily Western financial market data could limit its utility for non-English speaking users or those from regions with different financial ecosystems. We recognize these potential barriers and would need to consider internationalization, language support, and potentially simplified offline or low-tech versions to ensure broader demographic inclusivity.
